            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
               <p>  Hello fellow bootcampers, my name is Charles Cox. I currently live in northern Califorina. 
                    Prior to deciding to attend bootcamp, I lived in Los Angeles, where I worked as an audio engineer
                    for about 8 years. I've had a chance to work with artists such as Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, 24k Goldn, etc.. 
                    I have no prior experience with coding or web development but I am up for the challenge!!
                    Besides music, I enjoy watching sports and playing xbox (very typical male hobbies lol) and 
                    I'll probably do pretty much anything if you offer me a slice of pizza. Looking forward to meeting and connecting
                    with everyone, cheers!
                </p>
